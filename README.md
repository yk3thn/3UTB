# 3UTB

very old triggerbot i made for siege.
source code has the debugging messagebox instead of actually clicking, the non test release doesnt.

KEY: test

how to run:

-download dotnet 8.0 runtime
-open the run.bat file
-select your settings and click start

this is probably 80% pasted considering the code is so organized
if you improve this please share it with me
